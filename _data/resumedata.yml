  bio: I am pretty good at programming in Python and Machine Learning and integrating
    multiple things (databases, APIs, statistics, coffee, puppy's tears) to build
    out an application. That should technically make me a full-stack MLE?

    Occasional bad jokes and serious discussions about Italian wine might be expected from me from time to time.
  contactmessage: Please reach out to me. I'm so lonely.
